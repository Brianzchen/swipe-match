## Sanity checks

- yarn test (test)
- yarn lint (code format)
- yarn flow (type checker)
- yarn analyze (bundle size)

### UX misalignments

- Spacing has been guessed but follows 8px grid
- Design icons not available, using material design icons
- Font chosen was Google's Noto
- Colors were approximated with browser inspect tools
- Font sizes were guessed and used relatively across the application
